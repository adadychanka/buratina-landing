# Code Style

## General Rules

- All code and comments must be in English
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Follow Biome linting rules
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Prefer named exports over default exports when possible
- Add comments explaining complex logic for future understanding
- Create additional documentation files for complex modules when needed

## TypeScript

- No `any` types - use proper types or `unknown`
- Use `import type` for type-only imports
- Ensure TypeScript types are correct
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## Code Quality

- Run Biome checks before committing
- Fix all linting errors
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names

# Cursor Rules for Buratina Bar Landing Page

## Project Context
This is a landing page for Buratina Bar - a bar in Belgrade. The project uses Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

## Code Style
- All code and comments must be in English
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Follow Biome linting rules
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Prefer named exports over default exports when possible
- Add comments explaining complex logic for future understanding
- Create additional documentation files for complex modules when needed

## Architecture
- Use Next.js App Router structure
- Components in `src/components/`
- Sections in `src/components/sections/`
- UI components from shadcn/ui in `src/components/ui/`
- Utilities in `src/lib/utils/`
- Types in `src/types/`
- Hooks in `src/hooks/`
- API routes in `src/app/api/`
- Validation schemas in `src/lib/validations/`

## Internationalization
- Use next-intl for all text content
- Translation files in `src/messages/`
- Support locales: en, ru, sr
- Always use `useTranslations` hook for text
- Never hardcode text strings - always use translations
- Add new translation keys to all locale files (en.json, ru.json, sr.json)

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use shadcn/ui components as base
- Customize components through Tailwind classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Use CSS variables from globals.css for theming
- All components should be fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Form Handling
- Use React Hook Form for form management
- Use Zod for validation schemas
- Share validation schemas between client and server (in `src/lib/validations/`)
- Always validate on both client and server
- Show user-friendly error messages from validation

## API Routes
- All API routes in `src/app/api/`
- Use Next.js Route Handlers (route.ts)
- Always validate input with Zod schemas
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Handle errors gracefully with try-catch
- Use environment variables for sensitive data (never commit secrets)

## Email and Notifications
- Use Resend for email sending
- Environment variables: RESEND_API_KEY, RESEND_FROM_EMAIL, CONTACT_EMAIL
- Send notifications to Telegram via HTTP API
- Format emails as HTML with proper styling
- Format Telegram messages with emojis and HTML formatting

## Code Quality
- Run Biome checks before committing
- Fix all linting errors
- Ensure TypeScript types are correct
- No `any` types - use proper types or `unknown`
- Use `import type` for type-only imports
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## Component Guidelines
- Use 'use client' directive only when necessary (for interactivity, hooks, event handlers)
- Server Components by default for better performance
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use shadcn/ui components and customize as needed

## File Naming
- Use PascalCase for components: `ContactForm.tsx`
- Use camelCase for utilities: `cn.ts`, `formatDate.ts`
- Use kebab-case for API routes: `route.ts`
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors in try-catch blocks
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors to console for debugging
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes in API routes
- Show error states in UI components

## Performance
- Use next/image for all images
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Optimize bundle size
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Minimize client-side JavaScript

## SEO
- Add proper metadata to all pages
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata
- Generate sitemap.xml automatically
- Configure robots.txt properly
- Use canonical URLs for multilingual content

## Git Workflow
- Make logical commits after each feature/step
- Never commit secrets or environment variables
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when possible

## Testing and Development
- Test forms thoroughly before deployment
- Verify all translations work correctly
- Test responsive design on multiple devices
- Check accessibility (a11y) requirements
- Verify API routes work with proper error handling

## Environment Variables
- Never commit .env files
- Use .env.example for documentation
- All environment variables must be documented
- Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix only for client-side variables

## Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use exact versions for critical dependencies when needed
- Document why specific libraries are used
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies

## Future Considerations
- PDF viewer for menu (react-pdf)
- Google Maps or Leaflet integration for location
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Analytics integration (Google Analytics)
- Performance monitoring
